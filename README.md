### Overview
We propose a novel **R**obust **A**ttributed **G**raph **C**lustering (**RAGC**), incorporating **H**ybrid-**C**ollaborative **A**ugmentation (**HCA**) and **C**ontrastive **S**ample **A**daptive-**D**ifferential **A**wareness (**CSADA**). The overall framework of **RAGC** is illustrated in Fig. 1.<br>
